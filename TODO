Well everything really, but this is here to add things
which we certainly must not forget:

!!SECURITY!!

We need to come up with some sort of security concept for the
vdagent daemon and the vdagent clients communication.

Yes client_s_  as there can be multiple xorg sessions running
when for example the switch user functionality is used. But we
don't want Bob to be getting access to Alice's clipboard through
vdagent!

One possible option is to ask ConsoleKit who the current Console
owner is and then only send messages to / accept messages from
agents whose unix domain socket has the same uid.

Various small things:
-make uinput communication non blocking
-remove width and height options from vdagentd
 -maybe not create an input device at all until we've gotten a
  width / height, this would mean also not connecting to the virtio
  serial-port as connecting to the serial port causes client
  mouse mode
