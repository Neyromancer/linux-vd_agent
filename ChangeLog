spice-agent-0.8.1
-----------------
* In daemon mode the session vdagent now retries connecting to the system
  vdagentd every second, once a connection is made a version check is done,
  if the version differs (which only happens on an upgrade from one version
  to the next) the sesion vdagent re-execs itself (Marc-André Lureau)

spice-agent-0.8.0
-----------------
* Add support for copy and paste using the primary selection, to use this
  you need a spice-gtk widget based client and the latest spice-gtk code
  (Marc-André Lureau and Hans de Goede)
* Autotoolized (Christophe Fergeau)
* Allow building without consolekit, for systems which don't have ck, such
  as RHEL-5 (Christophe Fergeau)
* Various small bugfixes (Hans de Goede)

spice-agent-0.6.3
-----------------
* Initial release, starting with version nr 0.6.3, to indicate that it
  more or less supports all parts of the cdagent protocol in spice-protocol
  and spice 0.6.3
