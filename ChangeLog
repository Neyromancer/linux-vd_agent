-------------------
* In daemon mode the session vdagent now retries connecting to the system
  vdagentd every second, once a connection is made a version check is done,
  if the version differs (which only happens on an upgrade from one version
  to the next) the sesion vdagent re-execs itself (Marc-André Lureau)

spice-vdagent-0.8.0

  as RHEL-5 (Christophe Fergeau)
