Spice agent for Linux
=====================

The spice agent for Linux consists of 2 parts, a daemon spice-vdagentd and
a per X-session process spice-vdagent. The daemon gets automatically started
in Spice guests through a udev rule. The per X-session gets automatically
started in desktop environments which honor /etc/xdg/autostart, and under
gdm.

The main daemon needs to know which X-session daemon is the currently
active X-session (think switch user functionality) for this console kit is
used. spice-vdagent will not work without console kit.

Features:
* Client mouse mode (no need to grab mouse by client, no mouse lag)
  this is handled by the daemon by feeding mouse events into the kernel
  via uinput. This will only work if the active X-session is running a
  spice-vdagent process so that its resolution can be determined.
* Automatic adjustment of the X-session resolution to the client resolution
* Support of copy and paste (text and images) between the active X-session
  and the client

Not handled: multiple displays.

Enjoy,
